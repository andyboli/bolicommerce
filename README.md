A product search engine that connects to the free market and Buscapé page.

## Context

This project was made to fulfill the selection process of the Lexartlabs company for the position of FullStack programmer.

## Business Model

Create a product search engine that connects to the free market and Buscapé (web scrap) page.

- Through a drop-down menu we can choose the categories: Mobile, Refrigerator, TV.
- Through a drop-down menu we can choose the site: Mercado Livre / Buscapé
- Create a free text entry to search for products
- After searching the list of products that will appear on the screen with: Photo, description, category, price and website where the information was obtained
- Store results in database after user search. If you repeat the same search (only take into account the category and web filters to store), show what leaves the base and don't undo it for the webs.
- Host the solution online on a free server like heroku or some other alternative.

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
