A product search engine that connects to the free market and Buscapé page.

## Context

This project was made to fulfill the selection process of the Lexartlabs company for the position of FullStack programmer.

## Business Model

Create a product search engine that connects to the free market and Buscapé (web scrap) page.

- Through a drop-down menu we can choose the categories: Mobile, Refrigerator, TV.
- Through a drop-down menu we can choose the site: Mercado Livre / Buscapé
- Create a free text entry to search for products
- After searching the list of products that will appear on the screen with: Photo, description, category, price and website where the information was obtained
- Store results in database after user search. If you repeat the same search (only take into account the category and web filters to store), show what leaves the base and don't undo it for the webs.
- Host the solution online on a free server like heroku or some other alternative.
